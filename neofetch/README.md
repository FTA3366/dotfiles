# General installation instructions
For each of the themes, you'll have to download the art file (if applicable), as well as neofetch.conf.

You can do this with wget with the example command `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FTA3366/dotfiles/main/neofetch/bruh/ascii_bruh`.

You will then have to move neofetch.conf to your `~/.config/neofetch` folder, and point the art (if applicable) to its correct location.

*More detailed information may or may not be present for each of the themes.*

## TLDR

1. Download raw files
2. Place config in `~/.config/neofetch`
3. Edit config to load art (if applicable)
